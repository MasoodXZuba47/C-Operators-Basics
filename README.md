## C Operators Basics

This repository contains a simple C program demonstrating the basic operators used in the C programming language.

It is designed for beginners who want to understand how different types of operators work in C with practical examples.


## TOPICS COVERED

1. Arithmetic Operators
+  Addition
-  Subtraction
*  Multiplication
/  Division
%  Modulus
++ Increment
-- Decrement

## 2. Assignment Operators
=   Simple assignment
+=  Add and assign
-=  Subtract and assign
*=  Multiply and assign
/=  Divide and assign
%=  Modulus and assign
&=  Bitwise AND assign
|=  Bitwise OR assign
^=  Bitwise XOR assign
<<= Left shift assign
>>= Right shift assign

## 3. Comparison Operators
== Equal to
!= Not equal to
>  Greater than
<  Less than
>= Greater than or equal to
<= Less than or equal to

## 4. Logical Operators
&& Logical AND
|| Logical OR
!  Logical NOT


## HOW TO RUN

Step 1: Make sure you have a C compiler installed (GCC recommended).

Step 2: Compile the program:

gcc main.c -o output

Step 3: Run the program:

./output



## PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT

- Practice C programming fundamentals
- Understand how operators work
- Learn how operators modify variable values
- Build strong programming basics


## OUTPUT

The program prints:
- Arithmetic operation results
- Final result after assignment operations
- Comparison results (0 = false, 1 = true)
- Logical operation results
