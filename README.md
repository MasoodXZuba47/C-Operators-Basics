# C Operators Basics

This repository contains a simple C program demonstrating different types of operators in the C programming language.

---

## 1. Arithmetic Operators

- `+`  Addition  
- `-`  Subtraction  
- `*`  Multiplication  
- `/`  Division  
- `%`  Modulus  
- `++` Increment  
- `--` Decrement  

---

## 2. Assignment Operators

- `=`   Simple assignment  
- `+=`  Add and assign  
- `-=`  Subtract and assign  
- `*=`  Multiply and assign  
- `/=`  Divide and assign  
- `%=`  Modulus and assign  
- `&=`  Bitwise AND assign  
- `|=`  Bitwise OR assign  
- `^=`  Bitwise XOR assign  
- `<<=` Left shift assign  
- `>>=` Right shift assign  

---

## 3. Comparison Operators

- `==` Equal to  
- `!=` Not equal to  
- `>`  Greater than  
- `<`  Less than  
- `>=` Greater than or equal to  
- `<=` Less than or equal to  

---

## 4. Logical Operators

- `&&` Logical AND  
- `||` Logical OR  
- `!`  Logical NOT  

---

## How to Run

Compile:

```bash
gcc main.c -o output
```

Run:

```bash
./output
```

---

## Purpose

- Practice C fundamentals  
- Understand operator behavior  
- Strengthen programming basics  

---

## Output

The program prints:
- Arithmetic results  
- Assignment results  
- Comparison results (0 = false, 1 = true)  
- Logical results
